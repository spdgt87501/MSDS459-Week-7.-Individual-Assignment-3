Part 5 - Sentiment Analysis

In sentiment analysis, text data is analyzed to determine whether the statements contained are generally negative or positive about a given subject (Quant Club, 2024). This can be applied to evaluation of investments.  Analyzing the sentiment of news articles can determine if recent events concerning the organization may affect them positively or negatively (Moody’s, 2024).  Similarly, sentiment from social media posts mentioning the organization could be utilized to gauge the overall mood around something like an IPO (Quant Club, 2024).

There are some benefits to this approach. First, sentiment analysis can improve predicative accuracy by allowing investors to consider factors external to an organization.  Second, sentiment analysis allows for quicker reactions to current events whereas methodologies relying on public financial statements wouldn’t see the effects until results for that time period are released (Moody’s, 2024).  

There are also some downsides to this approach.  First, text data and the sentiment contained may not be clear or noisy. Second, text containing the use of sarcasm, irony, or cultural references may be difficult for a machine to correctly assess for sentiment.  Third, when used in isolation, sentiment analysis can be misled by market fads and contribute to market bubbles (Mecanti, 2024).

This approach could be useful in the main project for this class.  Teams could gather news articles or social media posts related to specific corporations.  This text data could then be analyzed for sentiment to predict the future potential prospects of that stock and the results stored in the knowledge graph for retrieval.
