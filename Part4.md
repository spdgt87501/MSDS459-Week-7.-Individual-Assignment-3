Part 4 - Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is a statistical method of evaluating future stock performance based on movements in the stock’s price and trading volume (Hayes, 2024).  There are some benefits to this approach.  First, this methodology has the potential to allow traders to profit from short term volatility.  Second, when used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis may allow a trader to take advantage of volatility in the market by timing their purchase when it may be cheaper (Daly, 2025).

This approach also has some limitations.  First, some studies have shown that results of typical approaches to technical analysis have a accuracy rate of barely over 50 percent.  Second, technical analysis does not consider factors such as a company’s earnings or external factors such as political changes (Daly, 2025).

This approach could be useful for teams in the class project.  Teams could gather stock price and trading data over time for specific stocks.  This data could then be used in a technical analysis to determine if and when to purchase that stock.
