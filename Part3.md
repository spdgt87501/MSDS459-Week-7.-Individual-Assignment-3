Part 3 - Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method by which investors determine the overall value of a company by looking at the company’s financial situation.  This information can come from evaluating things such as assets, debt, and revenue (Segal, 2025).  According to TD Bank, n.d., there are two potential benefits from utilizing fundamental analysis.  First, fundamental analysis allows the investor to understand the asset’s financial health and whether its stock price is reflective of its current value.  Second, fundamental analysis can reveal information such as heavy debt or negative cash flow that may affect the decision to invest.

There are also potential downsides to fundamental investment analysis.  First, unless factored in, fundamental analysis assumes that all investors act rationally on an asset’s current value.  However, not all investors act purely based upon information from balance sheets.  Second, since fundamental analysis relies on public information, it may not take into account an asset’s recent successes or potential future success (TD Bank, n.d.).

For the class project, teams could include information from public financial statements from target organizations.  To perform analysis, the team members could set up an algorithm to estimate the intrinsic value of those organizations from the financial statements.  This could then be compared to current stock quotes as well as the volume of outstanding stock for each organization to determine whether the asset is over or undervalued.
